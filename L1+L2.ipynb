The image looks distorted or grainy no matter what settings you change. Samsung VA panel is better for picture sharpness and brightness. However there are many good points about LG , their WEBOS offers lot of customisation of sound and picture. LG provided a very high quality wall stand with installation free of cost (MRP 5000) which is something like cherry on top.\\nI owned Sony, LG, SAMSUNG all 4K tv and I found Samsung as top display , SONY 2nd , LG 3rd. Samsung neo 4K 55inch was costing me ~4000 more so I went for LG. No regrets for money spent.

I agree sony would have given best possible picture quality.\\nThen VU GloLed was decent option that I was getting in 38k. With 2 cons. VA panel and other speech and dialogue clarity was not good.\\nBut then confusion was that should i go for known and bigger brand Samsung which was having Crystal ismart at 46k. Again with 2 cons. One VA panel and second samsung did cost cutting by giving remote without and voice assistant support.\\nSo 8k more for bigger brand.\\nBoth the TV had VA panel. And I have bigger living room with dinning area and bigger L shaped Sofa. So I needed ideally IPS panel.\\nLg UQ8020 was around 47k so that was third option and It was giving IPS panel. Which was plus point.\\nSo confusion was among those 3.\\nThen I read that UQ8020 and UQ7500 are exactly same with same screen quality with 2 difference. One UQ7500 does not have magic remote and second bezzels were very slightly bigger than UQ8020.\\nAnd suddenly UQ7500 was at 38k. Amazon was giving 5000 coupon. Plus 3k card discount.\\nThat point I finalized UQ7500.\\nI was getting IPS panel with best color and picture quality. Superb sound clarity. In my 14 x 10 living room plus dining area we keep sound at max 30 and it was enough. With amazing speech clarity and even music clarity. Bigger brand with known after sales service atleast in my area Navi Mumbai. And at the lowest price as compared to other chinese brand.\\nAlso i can purchase magic remote at 1500 which is compatible with this model. So sorted.\\nOnly Con i feel is WebOS. Which I can change by attaching fire stick TV anytime if I feel so.\\n\\n\\nSuper happy with the decision and the price point that I purchased.\\n340 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\n'),\n",

With SBI card EMI option, I got a very good deal of Rs.34.5k. Tv was delivered by Amazon on time as promised. Installation done by local LG technicians on next day of delivery. It was a Customer delight, as I did not expect this prompt service at Jammu.\\nAs my living room has very less Sunlight, my first choice was to have a VA panel Tv. Fortunately my Tv has a VA panel with very good level of Contrast. Upscaling of SD, HD contents are amazing. I have seen HD Plus and 4K contents on different OTT platforms and the results are very much satisfactory.\\nHeard about WEB OS limitations, but all required OTT platforms like YouTube, Prime video, Netflix, Hotstar, Jio Cinema, Hoichoi, Sony Liv, Zee5 - all are available. Web OS is fast enough in response.\\nAs I had already a good Sound Bar, so sound quality is not a problem for me. But I have tested it without Sound Bar and the TV speakers (20W) had produced very good quality sound. With AI technology, distinct Voice output is heard.\\n\\n\\nThe only Con which I experienced is the Remote delivered with this Tv. It is an IR remote and very difficult to get use of it. After installing LG ThinQ app on my mobile, I felt relieved to some extent.\\n\\n\\nSo request to LG to provide its Magic Remote with this model, as well.\\n\\n\\nOverall I am quite satisfied with this Tv and it is a Good Value For Money deal for me.\\n52 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\n'),\n",

Will be a great decision to go for this.\\n\\n\\nThe only 2 grievances I have with this TV is the remote and the OS.\\n\\n\\nThe remote has so many buttons!

Filmmaker mode is very good.\\n2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels\\n3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful.\\nI have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os.\\n4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative.\\n5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds\\n6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing.\\nLooking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.\\n\\n\\n7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.\\n\\n\\n8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv.

I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on.\\n\\n\\nDelivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.\\n\\n\\nSound:\\nPer other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.\\n\\n\\nPicture:\\nThe Panel\\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\\'t perfectly black - and they\\'re brighter than you\\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.\\n\\n\\nConnectivity:\\nI have a 35 Mb/s broadband connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.\\n\\n\\nApps & Features:\\nHas all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\\'t produce the contrast you\\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.\\n\\n\\nRemote:\\nVery basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung\\'s SmartThings App, but guess what - you can\\'t even use your phone\\'s keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it\\'s not there yet.\\n\\n\\nAttached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV\\'s design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.\\n\\n\\nI\\'d say I\\'m really happy - and given the chance, wouldn\\'t change my decision. It\\'s a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I\\'d highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.\\n1,140 people found this helpful\\nHelpful\\n'),\n",

The LG TV's display was described as not as sharp as Samsung's or Sony's, with images appearing distorted or grainy regardless of the settings. The Samsung VA panel was noted for its superior picture sharpness and brightness.\\n\\nIn terms of audio, the reviewer found the sound output of the LG TV to be decent, but did not provide a comparison with Samsung or Sony TVs.\\n\\nIn terms of smart capabilities, the reviewer praised LG's WEBOS for offering a lot of customization options for sound and picture. However, no comparison was made with the smart capabilities of Samsung or Sony TVs.\\n\\nThe reviewer also mentioned that LG provided a high-quality wall stand with free installation, which was a bonus.\\n\\nFinally, the reviewer suggested that if you are planning to buy a sound bar, it's good to have a TV of the same brand. \\n\\nPlease note that this is a single review and may not represent the views of all users.
